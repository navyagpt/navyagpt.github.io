Developed t-SNE and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection models with
tuned perplexity hyperparameter for dimensionality reduction and predictive
analysis from very sparse data. Formulated and authored a novel architecture
employing autoencoders to project high dimensional data from the NIR images into
a low dimensional manifold. Implemented a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to derive
a parametric probabilistic model which was deployed to evaluate the consistency
in unseen dynamics.
