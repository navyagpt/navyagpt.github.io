Conducted protein content analysis in various chemicals using predictive
analysis and spectroscopy techniques. Assembled a dataset of 1000+ bands using
mobile and benchmark sensors to measure spectroscopic absorbance. Applied
Multiplicative Scatter correction and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) correction
to preprocess the data. Utilized convolution and Savitzky-Golay filtering to
remove linear trends and smooth the data for further analysis. Developed a deep
belief statistical model, achieving an R2 value of 0.91 with just 300 wetlab
samples.
