A RAG-based investment analysis system featuring TF-IDF and BM25 based document
retrieval, LangChain memory-augmented vector retrieval, and Named Entity
Recognition (NER) for company-specific insights. Utilizes BERT-based risk
assessment and GPT-powered investment insight generation. Achieved 22% improved
accuracy in backtesting against real market events. The system processes
investment documents, extracts company-specific insights using NER, assesses
risks using BERT, and generates actionable investment insights.
