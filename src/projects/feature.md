Precise classification of cancer types is a central problem for cancer therapy
and diagnosis. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
high-accuracy tumor classification based on RNA sequencing data. In this
project, we follow the methodology of Mohammed et al. [2021] in classifying
tumor types from among the most diagnosed cancer types among women (breast,
lung, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian) but test a greater diversity of gene
selection methods. Our highest accuracy methods yield better-performing test set
accuracy on held-out data than the original paper. Thus, our proposed methods
can aid in the detection and diagnosis of cancer in women and consequently aid
in early treatment to improve survival.
