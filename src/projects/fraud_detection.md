---

A fraud detection system utilizing Multi-Agent Systems and Chain of Thought
Reasoning to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. Features
graph-based transaction analysis with spectral clustering for pattern detection,
network analysis of transaction relationships, and node embedding for
transaction representation. Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 for human-readable
fraud explanations and explainable decision-making. The multi-agent architecture
includes Transaction Analyzer, Pattern Detector, Risk Assessor, Anomaly
Detector, and Explanation Generator agents. Handles 1000+ TPS with average
response time under 100ms.
