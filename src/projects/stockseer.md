Created a tool to retrieve and analyze stock data using the Yahoo Finance API
and yfinance package. Conducted fundamental and regression analysis, including
univariate and multivariate regression using exploratory variables such as
Walmart's rate of return, S&P 500 return, and the US Dollar Index, and a
response variable of the company's rate of return. Performed ROI (rate on
investment) analysis and correlation analysis to evaluate global stock market
performance. Implemented an EMA10 (Exponential Moving Average 10 days) indicator
for predictive modeling and forecasting.
