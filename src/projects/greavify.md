Designed and implemented an application to address grievances logged by college
students as a part of Smart India Hackathon. The application generated
appropriate responses and classified grievances using a sentiment analysis model
trained and tested on a twitter data-set with a moderately high accuracy.
Created a word2vec model which is fed into an embedding matrix, alongside a
neural network layer and used a bidirectional LSTM layer to improve accuracy.
Visualized the data and presented it using Power BI.
