Designed, implemented and pitched TextQuraton, a handwriting curating
application for parsing medical bills and using the data to identify fraudulent
bills. Implemented a modified DistilBert based classifier coupled with context
module and n-grammar alongside attention module. Developed spatial transformers
alongside a CRNN and bidirectional-LSTM module to parse handwritten bills taking
into consideration the augmented images. Achieved an accuracy of 93.67% averaged
over all the extracted tags.
