Spearheaded a team of 6 students(3 developers, 2 designers and 1 question
setter) to develop a web application for an online coding contest that had
participation of over 150 teams from colleges across India. Implemented an
algorithm which used the data collected during the tournament to award extra
points to people with the most points in a region, similar to capture the flag
and also didn't allow more than three submissions for a question. Coordinated
project goals, aligned deadlines, defined the UX, designed the features and
developed the application. Developed the application using SQL, HTML, CSS ,
JavaScript, NodeJS and hosted it using AWS.
